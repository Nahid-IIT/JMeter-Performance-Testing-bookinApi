Dear,

Iâ€™ve completed performance test on frequently used API for test App https://restful-booker.herokuapp.com
Test executed for the below mentioned scenario in server https://restful-booker.herokuapp.com/

- 500 Concurrent Request with 10 Loop Count; Avg TPS for Total Samples is ~ 98 And Total Concurrent API requested: 7000.
- 900 Concurrent Request with 1 Loop Count; Avg TPS for Total Samples is ~ 86 And Total Concurrent API requested: 6300.
- 1000 Concurrent Request with 1 Loop Count; Avg TPS for Total Samples is ~ 85 And Total Concurrent API requested: 7000


#### While executed 1000 concurrent request, found 109 request got connection timeout and error rate is 1.56%.
## Summary: 
Server can handle almost concurrent 950 API call with almost zero (0) error rate.
